      <p>r/teenagers is the biggest community forum run by teenagers for teenagers. Our subreddit is primarily for discussions and memes that an average teenager would enjoy to discuss about. We do not have any age-restriction in place but do keep in mind this is targeted for users between the ages of 13 to 19. Parents, teachers, and the like are welcomed to participate and ask any questions!</p>

      <p>This is a conceptual website made by me, u/aidswidjaja. It's a milestone for myself, but I won't be maintaining it further, so feel free to use the code under GPL v3.0!</p>
